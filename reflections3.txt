1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than
keeping all your work local?
A. One reason would be if you were doing group work with others.
If more than one person is working on a project, it would be
helpful for all parties to be able to access the files easily
from a shared space.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?
A. One good reason is so you have more control. If, for
example, you are in the middle of working on something in a
file, you wouldn't want Git to make changes on that file
if someone else were to create a commit.
